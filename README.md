# Kotlin RGB Lamp Controller

This application is designed to control an RGB lamp via bluetooth.

Introduction

This application is based on several tutorials from web and the java app I developed several years ago for my RGB lamp.
It provides convenient functionality for picking colors and sending their codes to the lamp via bluetooth.
